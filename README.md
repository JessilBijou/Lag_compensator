# Lag_compensator
Bode plot of Lag compensator for the first order Transfer function

THEORY

A system which has one zero and one dominating pole ( the pole which is closer to origin that all other poles is known as dominating pole) is known as lag network. If we want to add a dominating pole for compensation in control system then, we have to select a lag compensation network. The basic requirement of the phase lag network is that all poles & zeros of the transfer function of the network must lie in (-)ve real axis interlacing each other with a pole located or on the nearest to the origin. Given below is the circuit diagram for the phase lag compensation network.
